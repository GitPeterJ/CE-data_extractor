(2) The cycling of nutrients is critical for the growth of all plant and animal life on the planet. At its most basic level, the natural cycle sees nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium absorbed from the soil by plants, which are then consumed by animals (including humans). These nutrients are subsequently excreted and returned to the soil, where plants can take them in again. Throughout the biocycle, biomass absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere while growing. This effect can be magnified when these materials are subsequently reused or recycled. (3)\n<br>\n<strong>Where/how is it used in our economy (main sectors, main products, ingredients)?</strong>\n<br>\nEvery year, people harvest roughly 13 billion tonnes of biomass globally to use as food, energy and materials.

(5)\n<br>\n<strong>Why should we care from a circular economy perspective?</strong>\n<br>\nBiomass use is confronted with some dilemmas, such as the use of biomass as an energy source by means of combustion or fermentation, versus a more high-value application (e.g. the processing of residual wood for furniture). For every application, the highest value must be recovered. A general rule of thumb is that the fewer process steps a material has to go through for reuse, the higher the quality of the material it can contain.
